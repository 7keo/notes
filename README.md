# Notes

The aim of this project is to organise and cross-reference a collection of notes related to the inner workings of the Diablo 1 game engine.

The notes are currently organised into the following categories.

* [Functions](functions/README.md): function declarations.
* [Global variables (read-only)](rdata/README.md): global variable declarations in the read-only data section.
* [Global variables](data/README.md): global variable declarations in the read-write data segment.
* [Structures](structures.md): structure definitions.
* [Enumerates](enumerates.md): enumerate definitions.
* [Storm ordinals](storm.md): Storm.dll function declarations based on ordinal numbers.
